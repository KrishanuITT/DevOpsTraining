What is git and why do we use it?
Git is a version control system that is used to track changes in code and collaboration. We use it to maintain code versions, enable teamwork and it ensures good workflow.

What are the types of version control?
There are three types of version controle:
Local: Stores version locally
Centralized: It has a single central repository and everyone make changes at same time.
Distributed: In this every user has a copy of the repository and make changes locally and then merge them.

Which of these is better?
Distributed Version Control is better because it allows offline work, provides better collaboration, and has no single point of failure.

How do you initialize git?
Using git init and git clone

What changes will happen after git init?
It creates a .git folder which holds the changes related to it.

What is inside .git?
In this folder we have
 - hooks: stores all the hooks
 - info: exclude -> gitignore
 - logs: Keeps record of reference updates and actions
 - objects: stores commit history, blob, trees and tags
 - refs: it stores heads remotes stash and tags
 - config: stores repository specific data
 - FETCH_HEAD: stores temporarily the info about latest fetch
 - HEAD: it is a pointer which stores the currently checked out branch

What are commands related to HEAD?
 - git checkout HEAD~1
 - git reset --hard HEAD~1

How many types of merging are there?
 - Fast-Forward Merge: main branch no new commits (git merge)
 - 3-way merge: main branch has commits (git merge)
 - rebase merge: commits from one branch into another (git rebase)
 - squash: Combines all commits from the branch into a single commit (git merge --squash )

What is tags?
They act as snapshot or mark specific commit 
 - annotated tags: Stores metadata (author, message)
 - lightweight tags: Simple pointer to commit
 - git tag v1
 - git tag -a v1 -m "msg"
 - git show
 - git push origin v1
 - git push --tags
 - git checkout -b <new-branch-name> <tag-name>

How to create a new branch?
We can create a new branch in two ways:
 - git branch
 - git checkout -b <branch_name>
 - git switch -c <branch>

What do you understand by git remote?
Use to connect the local repository to the remote repository
 - git remote add origin

What is shell scripting?
Shell scripting is the process of creating commands in a file to  automate the task
- bash, sh, powershell

Shell Script to print date?

formatting: date +%d/%m/%Y

What does each no stand for in chmod?

Invoke-RestMethod -Uri <endpoint> -Method Post -Body <body> -ContentType "application/json"
Invoke-RestMethod -Uri <endpoint> -Headers $headers

Star Pattern?

function Pattern(){
    $number=Read-Host -Prompt "Enter a number:"
    for( $i=0; $i -lt $number; $i++){
        for($j=0; $j -lt $i ;$j++){
            Write-Host "*" -NoNewline
        }
        Write-Host ""
    }
}
