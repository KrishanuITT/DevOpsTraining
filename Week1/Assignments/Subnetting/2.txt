Problem:
Subnet the Class C IP Address 205.11.2.0 so that you have 30 subnets. What is the subnet mask for
the maximum number of hosts? How many hosts can each subnet have? What is the IP address of host 3 
on subnet 2? 

205.11.2.0
Class - C:/24 -> 255.255.255.0
Subnets required: 30

2^s >= required subnets
2^5 = 32

So we need to borrow 5 host bits
/29 -> 255.255.255.248

Hosts per subnet:
2^3=8
Usable hosts: 8-2=6

subnet-1: 205.11.2.0
subnet-2: 205.11.2.8
subnet-3: 205.11.2.16
subnet-4: 205.11.2.24

IP Address of Host 3 on subnet 2: 205.11.2.11

Subnet Mask: 255.255.255.248 (/29)
Hosts per Subnet: 6 usable hosts
IP Address of Host 3 on Subnet 2: 205.11.2.11
