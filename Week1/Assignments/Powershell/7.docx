Rest APIS

REST API stands for REpresentational State Transfer API.
It is a type of API (Application Programming Interface) 
that allows communication between different systems over the internet.

REST APIs use HTTP methods (such as GET, POST, PUT, DELETE)
to define actions that can be performed on resources.

Features of REST APIs:
Stateless: All data required to complete a request is present in this.
